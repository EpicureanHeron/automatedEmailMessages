Hello,

A representative from supplier ABC Inc contacted the University Financial Helpline inquiring about payment from PO 1000000.

PO 1000000 was created from a requisition that Joe Thor created. There has been no receipt or voucher against this PO yet.

I have CC'd the supplier on this email. Joe, if you have received the items, but have not created a receipt in EFS yet, please go ahead and do so. Then send the invoice to your cluster for imaging. If you need either the invoice or have a problem with the order, please reach out the supplier.

Let us know if our helpline can assist in anyway.
